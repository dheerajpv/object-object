## About

We all know that programmers are pretty lazy, I mean, if you're looking at this repo, that's proof already.
So we decided to create a Discord bot that would take care of your listless programming needs.

Nearly all commands are utilities to speed up your development process or to help you stay on Discord and never open a new tab.

-   Want to Google something but too lazy to open a new tab? We've got a command for that.

-   Want to search questions on Stack Overflow? We've got a command for that.

-   Want to stalk people on GitHub by looking at their repositoryies? **We've got a command for that.**

Invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=839151235860004894&scope=bot&permissions=8) to try it out, and see if it makes your life a little easier!
